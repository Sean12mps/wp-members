WP-Members 2.4.0 beta release information

Thank you for offering to beta test the WP-Members WordPress plugin version 2.4.  Please note that that this is a beta release and as such, there may be bugs that made it past the alpha stage.  As such, this is not recommended for use on a production site.  If you choose to use it in that fashion, you do so at your own risk.

If you do become aware of any bugs, please keep a list during your test and try to email me a list rather than one at a time.  Also, include any information related to your testing, such as:

What version of WordPress are you using? (WP-Members 2.4 requires WP 3.0 or higher)
Did you install WP-Members 2.4 as a clean install, or did you upgrade from a previous version?
If you upgraded, what version did you upgrade from?
Is there location that I can view the test site with any bugs or errors?

Any information that helps me reproduce the error makes it easier to track down and fix.

There will be new documentation and a new readme file for this version because there are some additional feature for the site admin to be concerned with.  I have not completed this yet, so here is a rough idea of what is new:

* changed the options in the admin from dropdowns to checkboxes.
* added "show excerpts" option
* added "notify admin" option
* added "moderate registration" option
* added "turn off registration" option
* changed widget to use wp_register_sidebar_widget and wp_register_sidebar_control


Notes about new features:


* Updated the Admin area with tabs for the various settings. This should make the panel more manageable.

* Added recaptcha to the initial registration
WP-Memebers will make use of the reCAPTCHA API for CAPTCHA support.  You can read more about this here:
https://www.google.com/recaptcha
When you turn this feature on in the settings, you will get a new tab for the reCAPTCHA settings.  You will need to enter an API key on this panel for it to work.

* Added agree to Terms of Service to registration 
This is on new registrations only, but will show on user update if the user has not previously agreed - as in existing users registered prior to this activating this feature

* Shortcode for members area and register pages 
This is an early adaption, not yet fully functional in all cases. Most specifically, it does not work with excerpts so you will need to turn off the WP-Members setting for show excerpts if you use this.  To use in the visual editor, the shortcode is [wpmembers] with a "page" tag.  So for the members area you would use [wp-members page="members-area"] and for a registration page [wp-members page="register"].  The big advantage of this over the legacy <!--members-area--> is that you can slug the page whatever you want and are not restricted to certain page names and you don't have to enter it in the html editor.  Also, multiple instances should work as well if needed.

* Contextual help in admin panels
I haven't written all the help panels yet, but the start of it is there.

* Custom users panel for managing bulk user activation, export, and viewing users by not activated, trials, subscriptions, expired, and not exported (subscriptions require the not yet released expiration module).  This is found under the Users menu in the admin. Using this should be self explanatory.


Code Improvements


* Cleaned up the email process to include a link back to the page the user registered on.

* Capture users IP address at registration

* Sets the logged in admin as activated when selecting to moderate registrations (prevents activating yourself and thus reseting your password)

* Added a toggle to the install script to force a clean update of all settings.  In wp-members-install.php line 32 change $chk_force to true (use with caution).

* Improved uninstall process to make sure we are cleaning all options.


Bug Fixes:

* Added stripslashes to dialogs
* Fixed sidebar bug
* Changed registration process, update process, and admin update user process to not use unused custom fields (however, WP does put in empty values for native WP fields).


Thanks again for your willingness to test my beta version.  I appreciate the effort.
