WP-Members 2.3.0 beta release information

Thank you for offering to beta test the WP-Members WordPress plugin version 2.3.  Please note that that this is a beta release and as such, there may be bugs that made it past the alpha stage.  As such, this is not recommended for use on a production site.  If you choose to use it in that fashion, you do so at your own risk.

If you do become aware of any bugs, please keep a list during your test and try to email me a list rather than one at a time.  Also, include any information related to your testing, such as:

What version of WordPress are you using?
Did you install WP-Members 2.3 as a clean install, or did you upgrade from a previous version?
If you upgraded, what version did you upgrade from?
Is there location that I can view the test site with any bugs or errors?

Any information that helps me reproduce the error makes it easier to track down and fix.

There will be new documentation and a new readme file for this version because there are some additional feature for the site admin to be concerned with.  I have not completed this yet, so here is a rough idea of what is new:

* changed the options in the admin from dropdowns to checkboxes.
* added "show excerpts" option
* added "notify admin" option
* added "moderate registration" option
* added "turn off registration" option
* changed widget to use wp_register_sidebar_widget and wp_register_sidebar_control

Notes about new features:

Show Excerpts

This was added in order to show the excerpted text before the 'more' tag above the login/registration form when the user is not logged in.  This should help with SEO and linking to social media as there will be more than just the login/registration form when going directly to a blocked page/post.  If you use this feature, you should update your dialog text for restricted posts/pages accordingly (the clean default install does this already, but an upgrade leave show excerpts off by defualt and leaves the custom dialog alone in case it had been changed).

Notify Admin

This notifies the site admin of each new registration.  It uses the admin email that you have specified in your WP settings (see Settings > General).  It is turned off by default.

Moderate Registration

Turned off by default.  This holds all new registrations for approval by an admin.  It can be used in conjunction with Notify Admin above.  At present, users are approved individually as it is assumed that the user info should be reviewed prior to approval (also, I have yet to build a table for bulk processing).  If the user has not been approved, there is a check box at the bottom of the Edit User page (Users > Users, then select Edit under an individual user).  Once the user is approved, a random password is set and then emailed to the user (rather than at registration).

Turn Off Registration

This turns off all of the registration forms.  This may be useful to site admins that manage their users in some other fashion and do not want to provide a registration process, but rather simply use WP-Members login process inline with the content.  Note that this toggle over-rides Moderate Registration and Notify Admin.  You could have all of these checked off, but with registration turned off, there will be no registrations to moderate.  There is a warning message if either of those conditions are true, but it will only show if the admin has not turned off warning messages.

Sidebar widget

The login widget now uses wp_register_sidebar_widget and wp_register_sidebar_control, replacing the use of the deprecated register_sidebar_widget and register_sidebar_control.  You will likely need to update your widgets accordingly if this is an upgrade.  A clean install won't matter as you would be applying the widget anyway.

Thanks again for your willingness to test my beta version.  I appreciate the effort.

added recaptcha to the initial registration
added agree to Terms of Service to registration (new reg only, but will show on user update if the user has not previously agreed - as in registrations prior to this feature)
shortcode for members area and register pages (early adaption, not yet fully functional in all cases)
contextual help in admin panels

improved uninstall process to make sure we are cleaning all options


bug fixes:
added stripslashes to dialogs

Add table to the admin to include an iframe for ads





Possible RSS filters to help deal with excerpts


add_filter('excerpt_length', 'chg_excerpt_length');
function chg_excerpt_length($length) 
{
	// set the number to whatever number of 
	// words you want the excerpt to be.
	return 20;
}


add_filter('the_excerpt_rss', 'get_excerpt_len');
function get_excerpt_len()
{
	$content = the_content;
	$len = strpos($content, 'more');
	$len = $len-10;
	return $len;
}





this was the tag used for the admin to pump ads
