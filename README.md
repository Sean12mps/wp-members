# WP-Members #

WP-Members&trade; is a free membership management framework for WordPress&reg; that restricts content to registered users.

## Description ##

This is the beta release repository for the WP-Members plugin for WordPress..

## Usage Information ##

If you are looking for a production ready version of the plugin, use the 2.9.9.1 version hosted here:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-members/

This branch is the 3.0 release candidate, currently tagged as a beta version.  Keep in mind that this is beta, so it should be tested prior to loading to a production site

If you are trying it on a site that you might revert to 2.9.9.1, I have made adjustments to the install in this branch to keep the previous (2.x compliant) settings intact.  The final 3.0 will use new settings which will update and overwrite current settings of earlier versions.
