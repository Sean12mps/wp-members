# WP-Members #

WP-Members&trade; is a free membership management framework for WordPress&reg; that restricts content to registered users.

## Description ##

This is the "bleeding edge" repository for the WP-Members plugin for WordPress.

There are currently two branches here.  One is the 3.0 branch build.  The master branch is the 3.0 (very) alpha version built on the 2.9.9.1 base code.

## Usage Information ##

If you are looking for a production ready version of the plugin, use the 2.9.9.1 version hosted here:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-members/

If you are testing 3.0, you can try one of the two branches hosted here, as follows:

1. If you are trying it on a site that you might revert to 2.9.9.1, then use the master branch. I have made adjustments to the install in this branch to keep the previous settings intact.  The final 3.0 will use new settings which will update and overwrite current settings of earlier versions. So if you might roll-back, you need the 3.0 build on 2.9.9.1 code base.

2. If you are testing on a test site that will not need to roll back, you can use the 3.0 branch or the master branch.  3.0 is the development branch, so at any given time, it may or may not be completely stable and debugged.
